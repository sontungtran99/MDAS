# MDAS
Meteorological Dangers Alert System (MDAS) aims to send SMS prewarn residents in mountainous, isolated areas of Vietnam, whose lack of communication means pose a direct threat to their survival if natural disasters happen; and one of the only ways to reach them is through SMS.


# To run the system:
- Create an account on SpeedSMS https://speedsms.vn/
- Enter email, password and secret webhook password in changeWebhookUrl.py
- Enter SpeedSMS API token in sendToLocations.py
- Run Webhook.py, startNgrok.py and server.py simultanously
